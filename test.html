So you decided to build the platform for PCCoE college, where senior students can upload their notes, previous year's question papers, and other study-related materials. These materials can then be viewed and downloaded by junior students to aid their studies. The platform will allow students to share their knowledge and help their peers in their academic pursuits.

            Meet Rohit, a student at PCCoE who is studying computer engineering. One day, he gets stuck on a programming problem and can't figure out how to solve it. He asks his friends for help, but they don't know the answer either. Frustrated, Rohit turns to Google and comes across Stack Overflow, a popular Q&A site for programmers.

            He starts browsing through the questions and answers on Stack Overflow and eventually finds a solution to his problem. He's grateful for the help he received from the community and realizes that PCCoE could benefit from having a similar platform for its students, faculty members, and alumni.
            
            That's where our web application comes in. The objective is to create a platform where users can post questions, answer questions, and upvote or downvote answers based on their quality. The platform would have different categories such as programming languages, frameworks, databases, and so on, making it easier for users to find relevant questions and answers.

They would often work on coding projects on their own, but they felt that there was a need for a platform that could bring them together and help them collaborate.
            So you decided to start GeekforGeek Student Chapter. Where students can organize coding challenges, workshops, and events to help themselves and others improve their coding skills. ( Refer  CodeChef Pccoe Chapter Website or any coding club releated websites )
